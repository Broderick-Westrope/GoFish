# GoFish
This was a simple project that I gave myself after spending a few days learning Python. I'm sure it can be improved, but I'm happy with the results as it served its purpose.
## Gameplay
The game itself is based off the set of rules made by Bicycle Playing Cards, found on thier website. The game currently only allows for two players (one being the user and the other the computer).

The AI (computer player) is rather basic with simple awareness of the cards that the player has 'fished' as well as the cards in its hands. This AI works well for play against casual players but the flaws of the system can be seen when the code is edited to have two AI players versing, the results of which tend to be asking for the same card/s back and forth till the deck runs out. The final score of this AI vs AI tends to be around 1:0 (and vice versa).
